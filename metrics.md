####This is the place to tell us how you are going to measure your _awesomeness_

Business model information:
0.5% from each purchase goes to us.
Shops can use us for free but Credit Card taxes (Stripe 3% + 0.3â‚¬) will be payed by the shops.

Main metrics:
1. Number of recurring users (recurring user - more than one use per month)
Users that are using our app only once shows that there is a problem with our app
which makes the user not use our app.

2. Number of shops
Each shop will automatically guarantee us a noticeably big gain in number of users.

3. Average sum of each purchase
Since we earn 0.5% from each purchase it is necessary for us that the sum would be
as big as possible.

More interesting metrics:
4. Users will be given an option to retype their Credit Card information without saving it. (if many users choose
this option it might show their lack of trust to our applications security, they are afraid that their credentials
will leak)

5. Total time taken using our application vs using conventional payment methods. If there is no significant time
difference, it might indicate that the application is too confusing (time consuming) to use.

6. Number of items registered using our application vs using conventional shopping methods. If only a small amount of
items are purchased at once, it indicates that it is not convenient enough to scan large number of items.
